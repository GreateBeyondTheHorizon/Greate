Welcome to **Greate**, a Minecraft mod that combines the best of Create and GregTech!

## Features 🎮

* **Heavy Integration**: Alongside the tier system, the Create mod has been heavily modified to include custom machinery that is integrated with Gregtech.


* **Recipes Galore**: Whether you want Red Alloy Dust or Brass Ingots, the new tiered Create machines can now perform both!
